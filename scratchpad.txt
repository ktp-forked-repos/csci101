A.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./CourseGradeFileLog.py", line 21, in <module>
    fileLog = file(fileName, "a")
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'helluva/engineer.txt'

D.
The file, back1.txt, landed in the parent directory of the folder
where I saved CourseGradeFileLog.py. This is what I expected, as ".." is
used to signify the parent directory. 

E.
In order to correctly update 'helluva/engineer.txt', the currect
directory, parent of the currect directory, and the 'helluva' directory
had to be accessed and examined, in the following order: the current
directory (to find the .. entry), the parent directory (to find the
_PARENT_ entry), the current directory again (to find the 'helluva'
entry), and the 'helluva' directory itself (to find the 'engineer.txt'
file).
